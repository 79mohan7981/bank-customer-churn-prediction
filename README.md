# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model:

This project implements a machine learning model to predict bank customer churn using a decision tree classifier. 
The model aims to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Overview:

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. 
Predicting churn is crucial for businesses, especially in industries with high customer turnover rates like banking. 
By identifying customers at risk of churn, businesses can implement targeted strategies to retain them and minimize revenue loss.

This project uses a decision tree classifier to predict customer churn based on various features such as customer demographics,
transaction history, and interactions with the bank. The model is trained on historical customer data and evaluated using accuracy metrics.

## Key Features:

Implemented a decision tree classifier for churn prediction.
Utilized customer demographics and transaction history as features.
Achieved an accuracy of 84% on the test dataset and 85% on the training dataset.

# Requirements:

Python 3.x

## Libraries: 
scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

# Usage:
